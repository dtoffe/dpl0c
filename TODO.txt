- Rework AST to have just symbol table ids and not redundant names and values that are
    already present in the symbols, fix everything else depending on it.
    After this, fix the README item about reworking AST and symbol table.
- Rework parser to add error recovery using the technique explained in A+DS=P book by
    Wirth, adding or deleting one symbol from the symbol stream coming from the lexer.
    After this, fix the README item about adding error recovery.
- Add support for alias or nickname in the symbol table to allow for Pascal code generator
    renaming of Pascal reserved words and for C code generator renaming of symbols that are
    repeated in different scopes and need to be renamed when flattening the nested scopes
    for C code generation.
- Rework Pascal code generator to allow Pascal reserved words in the PL/0 source code and
    to rename them in the code generator using the symbol nickname.
- Implement the C code generator by flattening of the nested scopes and renaming of the
    possibly repeated symbols, the rest should be more or less similar to the Pascal code
    generator.
